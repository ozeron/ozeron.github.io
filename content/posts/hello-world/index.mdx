Do you own your phone or your phone owns you?


Recently I spent a week without all messenger apps on my phone.(except iMessage and Slack, which I opened twice)

I started to attack my social networks a while ago, and removed almost everything except Telegram. Finally I decided to remove Twlegram for a week and see what will happen.

Well it was easy, I was on vacation, and I had a lot of activity to do. But when I opened Telegram few days after start of the challenge, I noticed about five private messages and a lot of info from channels and groups. I realized that I’ve started to use Telegram not as communication tool, but as a news feed where I can spend a few spare minutes.

Second, I started to read more. Without social networks when I have spare time, I’ve opened my Kindle app and simply read the book. This lead to a lot of reading time.(I finished gorgeous Millionaire Fastlane BTW.)

As outcomes I decided to change my defaults when I use Telegram. I removed “Unread tab” and hided big groups from “Groups” tab. I kept only people and groups who are matters now for me.

Apps are designed to keep our attention. They are small suckers of our time and energy. Of course they can bring a lot of value and great things into our lifes, but we should watch out on them.

Also we have small choice over them: we can’t  disable stories from Instagram, we can’t remove useless notifications from Facebook. We often use them by default. And is this default is beneficial for us, or them?

Try to change your default. Switch to other browser. Kill all notifications, or remove all apps from your phone. You don’t need to quit social apps forever, but play this game and maybe you’ll get something valuable about yourself. Or you’ll find a better way to use apps, your own non default way!
