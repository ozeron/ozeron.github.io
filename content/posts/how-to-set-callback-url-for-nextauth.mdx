When you try to setup next auth and receive the following error.

```
[next-auth][error][signin_oauth_error] {
  statusCode: 403,
  data: `<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><errors><error code="415">Callback URL not approved for this client application. Approved callback URLs can be adjusted in your application settings</error></errors>`
}
```

You need to setup callback in format:

https://domain/api/auth/callback/[provider]
