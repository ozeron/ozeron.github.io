We live in fast world. Fast food, fast pace of change, fast information spread all this push us to live faster. Ever noticed how fast people walk in big cities compared to countryside? I noticed similar thing on the web. some People are binge watching Netflix, other are reading like one book a day. Some says they I can read one book a day. But this is bullshit, I think it’s better to read slow. Really slow and think about stuff. Here is why:
  - Slow reading give you space to think what author think.
  - Slow reading force you to curate and pick better books.
  - You get smarter not when you you read more, but when you think more. And when you do more. [Naval link]
How to do it
  - Ask yourself questions about content “What I just read about?” “What relative things do you know?” “How can I implement this in my life?” “Why is that?” “How is that?”
  - Put book back and think. Play with ideas. Find other similar cases for this idea. What is the limits of this idea. How this idea can be applied in your life. Can you transfer it to other domain.
  - Try to rehearse(remember) what you’ve read before. Write an essay, tell idea to your friend. Repetition of information will make it better.
  - Allow yourself to skim and skip water. Get to the main idea and just take it out.
Conclusion
Try to read slower, pick a great book. Give yourself time to experiment.
